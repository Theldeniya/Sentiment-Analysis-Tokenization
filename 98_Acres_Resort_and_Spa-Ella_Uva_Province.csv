Beyond the relaxing atmosphere of the villa located in a british tea state , the next best part was the fantastic top class food and excellent service at the Restaurant.

I think they don’t chlorine or clean well. I had a small pool bath on 12th of October 2019 and I started having a slight fever on the same day evening. And the next day the i got high fever and the whole body was in pain. Strait away admitted to the nawaloka hospital of Sri Lanka. And dr chandima de mel diagnosed its a germ call mycoplasma had infected me through the pool. I had to stay for a one week at the hospital to recover. Food was ok. Scenery was brilliant. Rooms are good. Good staff. But don’t use the pool.,Date of stay: October 2019

Beautiful locationThe view is unique and beautiful; and the location is very calm and quiet. 2. Healthy climateThe climate in Ella is not too cold. Therefore it is a very healthy climate to go outings at anytime.3. Outstanding serviceThe staff was friendly and helpful. They've surprised us with their own unique gifts.4. Very Good Road ConditionMost of the very beautiful hotels are very hard to reach. But 98 acres car park is closer to the road. They're providing transport inside the hotel for free of charge. 5. Lot of laces to visit from thereHence it was our honeymoon, we have visited only ""Little Adam's Peak"" and ""9 Arch Bride"" from there. 6. Adventure Sports (have to pay seperately)You can do activities like zipline, abseiling, archery, air rifling, and may more from there. 7. Surprise giftsI've heard that 98 acres staff is arranging surprises for special occasions of the guests if they've informed before. That was a surprise even for me, whom booked the hotel.Thank you very much for making our honeymoon a wonderful and unforgettable experience.B.K.T. Samarasiri05/09/2020",Date of stay: August 2020

The food was fantastic, as was the service we received. This hotel is very popular with foreign tourists and it is normally very difficult to secure a booking and then it is normally very expensive. We were lucky enough to secure a room at a lower rate as a resident of Sri Lanka during Covid times. Do be patient on arrival as check in takes some time due to strict adherence to Covid guidelines, you are however pre-warned of this in email confirmation. Our check in process was lengthy and we eventually arrived in our room at 3.15pm.

The service of the staff especially restaurant staff and 98 adventures was excellent!  View from Greenland Suite was rubbish as there was replanting of the tea bushes going on and we were staring at brown open land and not the lush greenery we were expecting. Bed in the Greenland Suite needs replacing...mattress was sunken in in places and the entire bed creaked! if you want to get jiggy on it it might collapse! thankfully I went with 2 girl friends :) Best views are from the rooms opposite the restaurant. Maybe insist on that when you book. If you want to try out the ATV take your driving license with u, they didnt mention this to us at the reception and we had to make a trip back to collect the licence and one girl didnt have it on her in Ella at all. Luckily she was able to get her bro to send a pic. No AC. We were fine as it was raining and didnt need AC but it can get hot if there is no rain.

Eco friendly environment. Friendly staff.It has nice location and view. Went to the little adams peak early in the morning and the view is superb. And also got a tuktuk ride to the nine arch bridge. Really nice place.Only downside is the choice of food. The set menu had fairly limited options. There isn't any selection for appetizers and soup. I had to bear with the appetizer and soup mentioned in the set menu. For main course there were few options, had to select one of them. For dessert I had to select 1 out of 2 options mentioned. Which is really disappointing. And also the children’s set menu is also a disaster. The only option was to choose from the ALA CARTE which I did paying extra.Although the food varieties are limited, the food is really tasty. Have to compliment the chef. And also I have to mention that the staff is very supportive.Overall I enjoyed a lot staying here. Good place for a relaxing vacation.

It ruined the entire trip. Though the hotel reception/ house keeping & others are really supportive & caring. Restaurant team was opposite of everything else. First they are not people friendly. Then they served the wrong items which didn’t order for our kids. When we asked them to return it & asked for what we ordered, waiter came back said they can’t change it. Where my colleague lost his patience & the the appetite as well. After the argument only he got what he ordered with a retaliation where our dessert got delayed more than 35 mins (banana fritters with ice cream). All 3 kids were waiting for it, but sadly though I have to take a call & walk away....end up buying them ice cream in Ella town. This is not the Sri Lankan hospitality we as customers expect. And I would never again visit 98 acres ever because of few idiots who doesn’t know how to treat their guests even in a worst economic situation like this.",Date of stay: July 2020

The cleanliness of the rooms was average and could be worked on in order to meet the high standards depicted in their website and fb pages. During our visit it was pretty warm and as they didn’t have air conditioning in the room it was pretty hard to fall asleep. Added to that there were inspects in the room which added to the problem.

It is situated on the hillside offering spectacular views of Little Adams Peak and Ella rock. This is a very small boutique hotel and the rooms are absolutely stunning. The rooms as set in 2 story stone buildings with four rooms in each building so lovely and small. The room was very large and had an equally big balcony overlooking the view. The bathroom was big with a waterfall shower. The hotel is environmentally friendly and there are lots of little touches everywhere that are in line with this, including no plastic bottles in the bathroom. The restaurant is in an open sided building and offers a good range of food. Breakfast is a buffet style and dinner a la carte with traditional Sri Lanka, Asian and English options. Food was ok but service was not the best. There are lots of activities you can do while here, such as hiking, mountain biking, zip lining and it is also close to the famous nine arch bridge. We actually walked there but you can get a tuk tuk there. There is also a gym and spa. The infinity style pool is located next to the restaurant, while it’s not particularly big it was never busy. The views at this hotel speak for themselves. It makes for a truly unique hotel.

The roof of our room was thatched and it seemed to have quite a lot of gaps in it so it felt a bit open to various animals who wanted to visit, I woke up to a squirrel on my bedside table one morning. The mosquito net on our bed didn’t really fit the bed. Lighting was also not great at night - quite dim and difficult to see, would have really benefitted from a couple of lamps to brighten things up. The walls also didn't go all the way up to the ceiling so not much in terms of privacy if you were going to the bathroom.The food was good, we had delicious meals both nights. They have a set menu with 5 (fairly substantial!) courses which seem to be compulsory. We tried to only have some of them but they kept bringing them all to us. A more relaxed menu where you could choose what you wanted depending on how hungry you were would have probably suited this hotel more.Little adams peak and the flying ravana zip line are an easy walk from the hotel - great way to spend an afternoon!",Date of stay: April 2020

Whoever we told we were going to Sri Lanka, they all said you must go to 98 Acres.  So we did.  Ella is truly breath taking - the views are stunning.  We stayed for 3 nights and it was delightful.  Surrounded by tea plantations, mountains, far reaching views - it's a dream.  Our room was beautifully thought out, we had a lovely balcony, plenty of room and a large bathroom.  I'm not a particular fan of open topped bathrooms but we coped.  the room was spotlessly clean.  This was probably one of the nicest places that we ate in.  The restaurant was great, delicious freshly prepared food, a wine list, plenty of choice.  The breakfast was extensive and the staff were absolutely delightful.  The pool area was nicely presented with cushions on the beds and plenty of towels.  Owing to the altitude, the pool water was refreshingly cool.  Nine arch bridge is a 20 minute walk away and Little Adam's Peak is very close by too.  In fact, you look onto it from your room.  There is also a zip wire minutes away.  Ella town is a 5 minute tuktuk ride away. Wifi wasn't brilliant as it kept dropping out.  I would definitely revisit this hotel in a heartbeat.",Date of stay: March 2020

There are 25 rooms/suites in separate 2 storey cottages. Located slightly outside of Ella centre, close to 9 Arch Bridge and Little Adam's Peak. We had a nice welcome and easy check-in on arrival. We stayed in a Honeymoon Deluxe room. We were wowed by the views when we got in, absolutely stunning. As we stayed in the last cottage of the row (Room 101) we had 180 degree views and it was fully glazed to make the most of the views of sunrise over the tea plantations, Little Adam's Peak and Ella Rock. Large and comfortable room with rustic furniture (handmade locally), and nice bathroom with huge tub facing the view. The shower was unusual, with a spout rather than a spray shower head, but we liked it. Good attention to sustainability and drinking water was supplied in glass bottles. There weren't many power sockets, but we managed to charge our devices anyway.The pool was a reasonable size, not good for swimming lengths but nice for a refreshing dip. Sitting by the pool you also have amazing views across the hills. The terrace restaurant had 360 degree views with a la carte service. The food and wine was nice, and reasonable price for a Boutique hotel, with some main courses below LKR 2000.Buffet breakfast also had a good choice and was nice, even better to enjoy it with the view.

Firstly it's conveniently placed between the 2 main attractions of Ella (Little Adam's Peak and 9 Arches Bridge) which are both an easy walk from the hotel. Secondly, the views are absolutely stunning - when we arrived, the sun was setting and I couldn't stop saying wow and taking pictures as we were checking in. We had a very warm welcome and a welcome drink before being taken to our room in a buggy. The room was stunning - we stayed in a honeymoon deluxe which was large, had a huge balcony, and an amazing bathroom. We ate at the hotel the first night and the food was incredible - one of the best meals we had on our trip and very reasonably priced. The only negative was that on our last night we couldn't sleep because a mouse (or a few mice) managed to get in the room through the thatched roof so we could see them scuttering around. We called reception though, and within minutes someone came to fix a little home which had formed in the thatching, so this stopped them coming in. The reason I haven't docked a star for this is because the setting is so rural and beautiful and the rooms so unique that it's understandable that some wildlife will get in!

The pool (which could do with being heated) and restaurant also had great views of the surrounding peaks. The food and service in the restaurant was great, as was the buffet breakfast - plenty of choice. It was also really handy for location - it took less than 20 minutes to reach Little Adam's Peak, as the route starts from the hotel. More signposting would be great, as it can be a little confusing especially in the dark before sunrise. It's also an easy stroll down to the route to Nine Arch Bridge, which is also worth a visit. The only downside was the room itself. We stayed in a standard room, which was quite rustic. I understand this is the vibe of the hotel, but for the price paid and a 'luxury' resort, I think they could do with upgrading. The shower was lovely and we appreciated the eco-friendly toiletries, which were refilled every day.

The best thing about the hotel is without a doubt the views - just stunning and so lovely to wake up to every morning, with the sounds of the forest too. You can see Little Adams Peak and Ella Rock from pretty much wherever you are in the resort. The pool and surrounding area is also wonderful, plenty of loungers and again, a beautiful view. We had breakfast and lunch at the restaurant every day, both were good, especially the breakfasts - loads of choice and certain aspects cooked in front of you. Lunch was ok. There was some mould on the cheese in my sandwich once but I let it slide! All staff we encountered were fantastic, polite and always with a smile, a credit to the hotel. The turn down service, plus fruit platter and daily cakes brought to the room were a nice touch. Daily house keeping also very good indeed. The resort is only a short walk to Little Adams Peak in one direction, and the Nine arch bridge in the other, so you can spend a morning seeing both very easily. We didn’t do Ella Rock in the end but it’s also quite close by. You’ll need to get a tuktuk down to Ella and back but it’s only 400 rupees each way and the hotel staff can call them up for you. We had a couples massage in the spa (full body). It was nice but quite pricey compared to other places in Sri Lanka. The reason I’m only giving it a 4 and not a 5, is purely based on the room itself. The hotel is apparently ‘luxury’ - and it just didn’t quite live up to that standard I’m afraid. The room was very spacious with a lovely balcony, but it was a little tired in places and smelt a bit musty. The lighting is also terrible - it just doesn’t feel cosy at night at all and you can’t actually see that well! On a final note, if you don’t like bugs this is probably not the place for you. Being in the middle of a forest, it’s not surprising that there were a number of visitors in the room at night. Including a mouse once! There are plenty of colourful birds and other wildlife to sit and watch from the balcony which was nice. Overall though, we did enjoy our stay and would recommend the resort to anyone looking for somewhere cool to stay in Ella :)",Date of stay: March 2020

This means it does not feel very private when sunbathing by the pool and can mean it’s not always possible to get a table on the terrace for lunch. It might be an idea to keep an area of the terrace for residents only in future. Other small things that could be addressed include the very tired towels at the poolside, the very cold water in the swimming pool and the use of linen napkins at dinner time rather than paper ones.Overall really enjoyed our stay and would recommend but it wasn’t the best place we stayed in during our visit to Sri Lanka, which came as a surprise as we thought it would be given its reputation.",Date of stay: February 2020

Located nicely away from the buzzing, high octane tourist centre of Ella, 98 Acres is a wonderful place to stay and enjoy the lovely cool climate and stunning countryside.  Our room was spacious and beautifully crafted from wood and other natural materials, and had a spectacular terrace overseeing mountains and valleys: sitting on bean bags to watch the sun rise (with tea) or fall (with something stronger!) was a real highlight.  The staff couldn’t do too much: due to their eco-friendliness they don’t do the standard, over-priced hotel laundry service, but instead took it outside of the resort and charged simply their cost price.  Breakfast and dinner were both wonderful, especially if you chose local options.  Lovely pool area with plenty of sun loungers, and gym area with the key equipment and view of the valleys.  Spa was expensive (in local terms), but frankly that’s the only criticism we can think of.  PS we are keen walkers: day time must dos were climbing Little Adam’s Peak (close to the hotel and not far, but requires a bit of scrambling for the last bit), and for us the highlight of climbing Ella rock – 98 Acres got us a tuktuk to the start of the walk, from where we climbed to the top to see breathtaking views, and buy a refreshing king coconut (it takes a few hours, so you need plenty of water).

We did not meet the manager, but had an email from him once we had left the hotel.  We were taken by buggy up a short slope to room 101, a Honeymoon Deluxe room which is the last in a row of similar buildings.  This room is on the upper level of a two storey thatched building and is made up of a bedroom and bathroom.  The sitting area referred to in the description comprises two rather grotty bean bags by the coffee table in the corner.  The balcony is on two sides of the room overlooking tea plantation and has a great view of Little Adam’s Rock and the Ella Gap, as do all the rooms.  Outside there are two wooden chairs with a seat cushion which are not comfortable and at the side there is a low table with two chairs without legs - I am not sure why you would use them.   A kettle is provided for coffee and tea making, but only two small bottles of water provided - in asking, we were given two extra so that we could make tea. The bathroom has a raised area built from old railway sleepers and a huge tub that takes 30 minutes to fill.  There are water spouts instead of taps so having a shower is like standing under a hose which is not a great experience.  The swimming pool is good but you can’t have hot drinks there.  The dining room is a large open sided thatched building set up with far reaching views.  There is one menu for all day use which is peeling at the edges and rather worn looking.  It would be an easy thing to reprint the menu to keep it looking fresh.  Whilst the menu is extensive, some of the dishes just contain too many ingredients but the chef is obviously trying to cover all tastes.  The buffet style breakfast has a fruit station (chopped or juiced) and an egg station as well as a large choice of both Sri Lankan and continental offerings.  However I do not expect to be given paper tissues instead of proper cotton napkins in a four star hotel.  The location is dramatic, with stunning views and the birdsong in the morning is wonderful as already noted in so many reviews and the staff are friendly.  The hotel is convenient for the short walk up Little Adam’s Peak and down to Nine Arch Bridge.  We also had a fascinating visit to UVA Halpewatte Tea Factory.  I think one night, or two maximum, would suffice here as there are so many other beautiful sights to see in this glorious country.",Date of stay: February 2020

There are not many suites at this hotel, so book well in advance if you are considering 98 Acres. The service and amenities are top-notch. You will have a butler who can help with anything you need. Since the property is perched on a hill, you may work up a sweat on the 5-10 min walk up to the restaurant (especially in the heat), but you can call a buggy to take you to & from your room.

First of all our standard room is tiny. I took out some clothes to put inside the closet and the piece of wooden shelf was so disgusting (to me at least!). I would describe it but it’s giving me goosebumps just thinking about it. The shower is like water shooting from a water gun, quite painful actually. I’m attaching a photo to show what I mean. The tap runs when you place your hand on the sensor so it was really annoying and awkward when you’re washing your face. On the plus side, the restaurant was amazing. One of the best meals we had in our entire trip. The staff are very friendly too though sometimes you need to ask for things a couple of times before they arrive. Another plus is the location. You can hike up to little Adams peak and very conveniently on the way there’s a zip line which costs 20 usd. Totally safe (they double and triple check the harness and equipment) and you zip through the lush greenery below. We also booked a massage which was also average. Took a photo of the bed which didn’t look and feel comfortable. The view was great but that’s all there was to our experience. I couldn’t believe the state of our room and so when the manager came over and asked about the shelf I asked how old the resort is. 9 years apparently. I felt like it was built in the late 80s early 90s. This obviously is still bothering me while I write this review. Yes the view is amazing but you get that from most hotels (Aliya in sigiriya and Santani in kandy). Maybe the villas are better. I usually take tons of photos of the room and hotel grounds and I didn’t for this one. I would probably skip this unless they change the rooms",Date of stay: January 2020

As this hotel is located between these 2 attractions, the location couldn’t be more perfect. There are many rooms, all offering a similar view, but the suite was particularly great because of the infinity pool and the extra space.The staff were very nice and our butlers (including Tarika) looking after us were always very friendly and helpful. We had room service breakfast on the last morning which was great and made for a very relaxing morning.The only downside we would say is that the quality of the food overall in the restaurant was quite poor. We were on half board so we ate dinner at the restaurant both evenings. For a place of this quality (and price), we were expecting high quality food and were disappointed both nights.

The hewn stone villas are big, but dark inside at night with moody lighting and very odd power points. The all-stone bathroom (with custom stone sinks and hose-flow granite “shower” head), have the functionality of a bath designed to enjoy the view, but exposes the toilet to those walking around the room - a light bamboo blind may be rolled down for more privacy. This room needs a coffee table or something to keep  belongings off the floor (ants & cockroaches) and beanbags are an odd choice of seating for a luxury resort. Different lighting is really needed to make the room more welcoming at night - floor lamp? bedside lamps?

The neck of flowers. But it was welcoming for the warm tea and warm towel. Check-in was quite fast. Thanks for that! The night team when I was there during week of election is superb. It was pouring heavily, I still wanted to go to the city to have a look and dinner, and he was all ready to help. He even kindly arranged for a tuktuk with Mr Ashok help to try to wait for me so that I can safely come back without worries Truly made my long and rainy day at Ella. Also after that I realised if it is raining maybe I could have asked a buggy to send me to my room up the hill a little.Breakfast is a sumptuous buffet spread with good view and sunlight. If you can have more time there, it is good as you can eat more and slowly :)It was strange that when I went out for a short afternoon walk, someone came to do room service right after I checked in 30mins before.. Made me feel weird. Other than that, location of the resort is good.  There is a short cut to the mini Adams peak via helipad route, saves you a lot of walk.They do not provide money exchange.",Date of stay: November 2019

The room was really lovely - notes to the tea plantations that you are nestled amongst with a sofa and TV area. Channels are limited but there was a good film channelWe made use of the golf buggy a couple of times as the steps up are quite long and in the heat it can be a push. The houses with the pools look incredible, we were on shoulder season and if it had been beautiful blue skies I would have been very jealous. The pool is cute not huge and not much space round it but their on loungers on all the balconiesThe food was ok, was not bad was not great it was just OK. The breakfast is buffet and was probably one of the weaker ones I had while travelling round. The room was lovely though and the setting is just incredible! So peaceful and always something to sit and watch whether it be birds, workers in the fields the changing scenery... it is lovely. I can not remember our room number I think it was 202 and it was perfect. We had a spa while we were there and this was GREAT! All home made products and the view from the treatment room was epic.

We stayed for 3 nights in a premium deluxe room and on arrival the view was absolutely breathtaking. Our balcony looked out over little Adams peak and the surrounding tea hills, we could totally see why this would be the top choice for everyone who comes to stay in Ella. However looking past the natural beauty of the place itself, there were some issues with the hotel which unfortunately dampened our experience:-When we arrived they had made up our bed with a ""happy honeymoon"" sign using rose petals and a decorative throw at the bottom of the bed. We then went out for the day and when we returned in the evening there had been a turn down service so the petals were removed, our bed made up for sleeping and mosquito net put down. It was only when I got into bed I noticed that the top of the duvet had several large brown stains on it - like someone had spilled tea/coffee in several areas. These looked old and dried and there were also loads of dead insects in the bed which made me wonder exactly when our bed had been made up - had the empty bed been left there for ages between the last guests and us?! We phoned reception and explained the situation but the person on the other end didn't seem to grasp the issue (it was quite late by then and he was likely a disinterested member of night staff). He did not apologise, and just said that he would send someone to change the sheets in the morning. The next morning we called again to complain about the sheets and once again there was no apology, and we had to chase them to get someone from housekeeping to inspect the bedding with us. When they arrived they tried to say that the stains were due to rainwater from the roof which was completely not true as a) the stains were massive and really dark and b) it rained during the night and we were totally dry so no holes in roof as far as we could tell! The new bedding they put down were clean but frayed and the duvet was very lumpy. This is just not something we were expect to find in a 4 star hotel and given they decorated our bed and we had a turndown service on the very first day, the fact that no one saw the stains suggests either incompetence or that they just didn't care. The absence of any apology points more to the latter.We had been told that the food here was excellent but the breakfast selection was quite poor. Juices and most of the fruit was not fresh. They offer to cut fresh fruit for you and bring it to your table which is a nice touch but in reality you end up with a couple of measly slices of watermelon and some underripe pineapple. The hot food had clearly been sitting there for a long time (likely leftovers from last night's restaurant dinner). I say this because we eat there right at the beginning of breakfast at 7.30am and the meat e.g. chicken or lamb curries were already dry with that layer of film you get when something sits around for too long. Service was also slow e.g. tea arrives with hot water but no milk for ages after you ask. The bathroom was worn and it took ages fiddling with the button to keep the rainforest shower on. Also each day they cleaned our bathroom they left a small crack in the bathroom window which let in lots of bugs.The brochure said there was a games room, when we enquired about this we were told this was removed after some renovations 2 years ago. Bit annoying that they hadn't bothered to update this information in the in-room leaflet.For a completely honest review I must say that this is still a fantastic hotel in a truly stunning location, there were also some nice touches e.g. each afternoon they came to our room with a plate of afternoon treats and on our last day we were given a tin of tea as a leaving gift. It's just a shame  that these issues above gave it a tired and lacklustre atmosphere which can be easily rectified with better staff training and some general care around the place. This may reflect that the tourism trade has been hit really hard recently after the Easter attacks plus we were there out of season. I am sure business will pick up soon but when it does I hope 98 acres takes on board our comments as it really didn't feel like a the luxurious experience that the brochure sold to us.",Date of stay: September 2019

We stayed in a Queen room with a balcony and the whole room setting was beautiful; spacious but still with a nice cosy boutique feel to the room. The bathroom especially felt like a mini-spa with its quirky touches (little mini teapots used for shampoo and conditioner in the shower were a very novel touch). The room had a mini-fridge stocked at a reasonable price, free water replaced twice a day, lots of free tea (in tea bags – a novelty in Sri Lanka!) to pick from, as well as a safe, mosquito net hung around the huge comfy bed, A/C, ceiling fan and TV (with DVD player – DVD’s were free to borrow from reception). The prime draw of this room though was the view – absolutely picture perfect uninterrupted view of Little Adam’s Peak and the Ella scenery, with tea fields in the forefront. The balcony was huge and wrapped around two sides of the room, with large patio doors leading out on to it – this meant we could enjoy the perfect view from the nice cocoon of our cosy bed! I woke at 5:45am one morning to enjoy the sunrise colours behind Little Adam; it was absolutely beautiful and definitely worth waking up for! I know others have woken early to walk up Little Adam and to watch the sunrise from there but after having gone up Little Adam during the day, I felt the view of sunrise was better with Little Adam actually in it! Do go up Little Adam though; it’s a short walk from the hotel via lots of steep steps (don’t do it in the middle of the day like we did) but a pleasant view of the surrounding countryside, and an amazing view of the hotel are offered from the top! From up there you really get the full feeling of how lucky you are to stay in such a unique hotel in such a splendid setting! The breakfast is served in the main restaurant with another beautiful view of the scenery; the breakfast was a good spread of Sri Lankan food and continental (toast, cakes, waffle station), as well as fresh fruits and juices. We also ate dinner at this hotel both nights we were there (the hotel is not all that close to places for walking distance) and were very happy with our choice; a nice mix of Sri Lankan food and European, all very reasonably priced and beautifully presented. The curries especially were very nice; lots of flavour and different sides to try, as well as a free pudding to pick from. There is a little souvenir shop on site that had lots of different teas to pick from as well as some original gifts that were very different from all the normal tourist tat (and reasonably priced!). We also had a massage at the hotel – I had the romance package that consisted of a full body massage and a scrub. The package lasted for 90 mins and cost about £45 (we went in September 2019, so exchange rates will vary). The massage was lovely; very relaxing and in a wonderful setting. The first part of the massage took place in a chair next to the window with the view of Little Adam’s Peak – the window was open so that a pleasant breeze could come in. The hotel grounds are beautifully maintained with gorgeous tea bushes, trees and colourful flowers dotted around. Absolutely stunning. We made sure we had an afternoon of nothingness planned for our time at this hotel so that we could just enjoy the grounds, chill on the balcony enjoying the view and have a wonderful massage. I would definitely recommend this hotel and do splash out for a queen room if you can afford it; the room is in a two flood thatched bungalow, so very quiet and private! We loved our stay here!",Date of stay: September 2019

We booked the premium deluxe suite which surely was a remarkable stay with a wonderful view of nature which any human can find peace to gaze over the countless green trees and listen to the captivating sound of nature. And more over the mountains you see from the view of the balcony kept us in awe. The room was super clean, attention paid to detail and the amenities were quite useful. The rustic feeling when you are in the room was quite soothing. Although there is no conditioning in the room, the climate of the place does not unsatisfy.The restaurant has a breathtaking view. The food served for breakfast was a buffet had a vast variety and tasted amazing. Every restaurant staff who met us spoke with a smile which made us quite happy. Its a short walk to little adam's peak & the nine arches bridge, a must go for anyone who is staying at 98 acres resort. The zip-line was a thrilling experience which one could scratch of a bucket list. you can unwind at the 98 acres spa with a massage of your choice which we experienced and for sure does not disappoint. I personally would like to thank for the diligence of the staff who arranged a surprise cake on the day of our anniversary since i did not mention it on the recent emails which i sent before i stayed at 98 acres resort. truth is, it was mentioned in 1 email which i sent out to the reservations department of 98 acres resort 2 years back hoping to get a booking for a 2 night stay that year which unfortunately i could not get since the resort was full. it showed how much attention the staffs give to the customer and i personally would like to salute you for the excellent service that you provide. To conclude, i highly recommend 98 acres resort. if anyone is searching for a place of pure peace and serenity. It is a fantastic place to stay with all friendly faces and views that you can hardly forget.Hope that we can visit sometime soon! =]",Date of stay: September 2019

We also tried the nearby Zipline which was great fun. The rooms are spacious, perfectly appointed with attention paid to the smallest detail. We were concerned there was no air conditioning but the climate is mild enough for a fan to suffice. The rooms are decorated in what we termed ‘High End Indiana Jones Rustic Chic’ (;->) and we loved every part of it.The resort is spread out and requires some walking but the staff were always on hand with golf buggy’s if we needed them.As a boutique resort, there were times we needed to wait for service at reception but this was minimal and understandable.The staff couldn’t do enough for us and always met us with a friendly smile.

You just have to walk on to your balcony to see right over the hills of Ella. It’s quite a sight, and one that only gets better when you wonder up to the restaurant.In terms of the stay itself, I thought the room was incredibly stylish and comfortable. However you will probably share your room with a few other creatures (I had a rather lovely lizard in my room), although they’ll likely just leave you to it. It’s a shame some of the things on sight shut quite early, meaning if you do only stay one night you will probably be unable to make the most of them. Also don’t make the mistake we did and take the shortcut back if you climb Mini Adams Peak for sunset...we followed the sign back to 98 resort and came up against a locked gate which you’ll have to crawl under!

I read great reviews about this hotel and it was on my wish list for couple of years for when I go to Sri lanka. Finally, we headed to sri lanka on Sep 5th and of course booked my dream hotel.I thought this stay would be the luxury highlight of our trip. But unfortunately, the experience was so disappointing and the property is overrated!! I am writing this review while I'm still here at the hotel, checking out in couple of hours. Overall the experience was dull and not worth it. So disappointing. On checkin, the reception welcomed us with refreshing towels and a welcome juice. Check in was fast maybe because we arrived late at the hotel around 6pm. We stayed at room 107.. small size room with amazing terrace overlooking Adam's peak and amazing view.. this is the only exceptional thing about this stay. The toilet is nice, small size with a waterfall designed shower (it's impressive but not practical for shower). There is a safe at the room, fan (no AC's) and a mini fridge.We checked the main restaurant for dinner that night, menue was average and quiet atmosphere, so we chose to eat in the town. The hotel is 25 minutes away (walking) from down town. We went there for a nice walk and dinner. Came back to rest after a long traveling day to find out that the bed is unbelievably uncomfortable!! Linens are very rough and poor quality (I guess it was old overwashed bedding set) .. and the bed squeaks with every tiny move!!!! Was so uncomfortable sleep. So after struggling night, woke up early morning and around 6am and thought to go for breakfast. Breakfast starts at 7:30am (which means we had to wait till the restaurant opened). Breakfast was average. But the second annoying thing about this hotel is that you have to pay for everything! You have to pay for your coffee at breakfast..  (they have 50% discount on cappuccino and late's!) Breakfast selection had srilankan food, pastries and an egg station. After breakfast went for a dip in the pool, and again when I asked for water,  it came with a cheque! You dont expect this in high end hotels. I asked the front desk to extend my checkout from 12pm to 1pm because I have booked for a 2 hours treatment at the spa, but they said they cant accommodate any late checkouts although I asked during checkin for a grace extension, and they said it's possible. After this stressful mirning, I walked down to the spa for my treatment..  I asked the receptionist if I can speak to the therapist to consult on the best package for me. He insisted that he can help. When I asked him about the differance between types of treatments, he kept reading the package description for me from the menue! I asked him couple of times I need someone to explain to me what to expect and what is best for my body.. he had no idea.. with such an non experienced spa manager with what's called personalized treatment, I had to cancel my treatment and spend the last two hours of this stay in my room..The only thing they got right was a happy birthday note for my partner on the bed the night of check in and a small cake on the breakfast. I have requested these when booked and they have delivered as requested. Again, overrated hotel. Disappointing stay. I guess because they have too many quests, they dont give you the right attention, a service or personalized experience.. so if you stay here dont expect any of these.. expect a dull average experience.",Date of stay: September 2019

Situated in the central area of Sri Lanka and up in a mountainous region close to all the Tea plantations. This was a three hour train ride from Kandy which was outstanding with beautiful scenery on the way. The food and drink on the train is provided by a local supplier and consists food like, Samosas and Chai Tea. Go first class though, its not expensive at all and at least you have air conditioning anything less than this you may find cramped and slightly uncomfortable and not air conditioned.  The hotel is an eco friendly hotel with quirky rooms based on the local produce, Tea. Rooms are large and very airy but, keep doors and windows closed in the evening as this area does suffer with lots of insect life. The rooms are not air conditioned but do have a large ceiling fan.As this is in a hilly/mountainous region you will have to walk up and down lots of hills and steep walkways. Make sure you take some sturdy walking shoes. If you suffer problems with knees or hips you may wish to consider whether this is for you. The local Town (Ella) is within a 10 minute Tuk Tuk ride and the main street has numerous bars and restaurants which are worth a visit. Some bars and restaurants do not serve Alcohol so its worth enquiring first.There is a Mountain peak near by (Adams Peak). You can climb this via a public pathway but, again lots and lots of steps to go up and down. There vis also a Zip Line which for those thrill seekers can have a go on as it runs down the mountain range.

When going through the reviews on Tripadvisor, we were a bit hesitant as the recent reviews did not seem to match the great things we had heard. But since we had already booked the hotel, and got a decent rate, we thought of going ahead. Right from the booking experience, the hotel staff was amazing. The response time was so good that I once thought it was automated. They were accommodative of all our requests and made wonderful arrangements for everything I asked to be ready for my wife's birthday.The location was great. Getting there was easy, and checking in was a breeze. The lady at the reception was friendly, courteous and helped us to improve our overall experience. This theme carried forward through it all. We booked a Premium Deluxe room, which was overlooking Little Adam's Peak and was amazing to wake up to. The bed was so large and comfortable. The room was the right temperature and the amenities were good too. The bathroom was great and clean.A highlight for us was the restaurant and the quality of the food and staff. They were so hospitable, respectful and great. They were attentive and fast, but not loud, nosy and quiet. They were the right amount of friendly without being too intrusive. And they were so accommodative of all our needs. Top quality service and training! The food selection was good, although if you are a vegetarian you might want to check on their menu options previously. (I'm sure they have a great plan for that too but something to keep in mind). Each item seemed to be perfectly crafted (all the way from the dinner buns, bread rolls to the bacon and the five-course dinner). The quantities were just right too.The bar menu is extensive and great. The 98 drink was a daily for us, and they even have a lot of cocktail options which aren't in the menu but are available on request. (Bit of an easter egg). Great selection of wine by the bottle too.Overall, I'd give it a 9/10 (in typical Sri Lankan fashion, it's time to nitpick a bit. This is more of really constructive criticism than anything to put people off).Our wishlist:The pool and the showers for the pool were quite cold, so a bit of heating would have been phenomenal.The outer verandah long-chairs and chairs were a bit dusty.

We went for half board at 270USD/night for 2. When we arrived there early afternoon, we were amazed by the beautiful scenery from the hotel and our room balcony, which is stunning. On the opposite, the interior of the room is very dated: the mattress was old and uncomfortable, there was rotten water smell from the bathroom and the electricity didn't meet proper standards. While this is ok during the day as partly compensated by the amazing view, at night it feels rather gloomy. the noise isolation isn't sufficient and the light gets through the door which has old style windows. We felt that for this price range this was not up to expected standards. The second major disappointment came from the restaurants. It started with our first dinner in the restaurant. The half board meant an ""a la carte' set menu. The starter and appetizers were tasty but the main dish and desserts were extremely disappointed. Below average industrial meat/pasta/desserts quality. The staff was ready to give us another dishes when they realized we could not eat most of ours but we didnt consider it as we felt we had tried enough variety. On the second day, we asked to cancel our half board plan which was easily accepted by the Guest manager (and we thank him for that as we could eat in town in a much better atmosphere and at a much lower rate). Regarding the breakfast, I had read a lot of compliments on tripadvisor but there again it came up as the worst breakfast during our stay. The juices cames from low quality plastic container that were not even hidden by the staff (were visible behind the counter) and the self service food was of a cheap quality. One thing i found ridiculous as well was the fact that ""premium coffee"" such as expresso/latte/cappucino were advertised with 50% off price during breakfast, which is very ""cheap"" attitude considering those are available and free in all other hotels visited during our stay (and elsewhere in the world in 4 stars and above hotels). Home made superior quality food would be clearly expected to raise the level in this hotel. I can't imagine how I would have felt if I had booked a superior room in the range of 300 USD and got this level of food quality... Third, we tried the SPA for a 2h massage and it was an OK/decent experience even though I am sure it was worth the 10 000 LKR/person price. This makes it a fair value for money. All in all, I would not recommend this hotel for a long stay (1 night is OK if you want to observe the beautiful scenery and are ready to sleep in a room which doesnt meet international standard with light going through and limited privacy). This is a popular hotel so the owners don't have issue to fill in their occupancy. Still, I am sure that investing in large refurbishment and upgrading the food quality could make it a jewel where people would spend memorable holidays. But far from it in its current shape.",Date of stay: August 2019

We had one standard and one superior room. The standard room was very small and we could barely fit in our luggage, but the view was totally breath taking. The superior room was alot better, almost twice the size, with great wet room and loungers on the balcony - but they are lower down on the property so whilst the views were still lovely, definitely not as good as the standard room. We stayed on half board and thoroughly enjoyed both breakfast and dinner. We ordered room service for lunch which was excellent value and I had a very good massage. Sadly the staff (in general) were less welcoming than many other places we visited, check in was slow and there was no real welcome, it didn't feel luxorious. Much as we enjoyed our visit I think the hotel does not offer good value compared to other places we visited. The rooms could do with a bit of an upgrade, but would I stay again?

The lobby was an unbelievably small area but due to that fact it was standing out. We were warmly welcomed. Since there were few other check-in's and there was only one receptionist at the desk we had to wait for a short while.  We asked for a room with the best view and we were recommeded the standard room. Who would not ask for a great view when they travel all the way to Ella! And above all, 98 acres is one of the most popular hotels in Ella so we expect a superb view. We were escorted to our room and when seeing the main do0or I was not so happy as it looked cheap eventhough the resort is not cheap at all. But I had a feeling that inside would be better than how the door looks from outside. When we entered the room we were shocked as it was practically looking like a room in a rundown shack. We informed the staff that we dislike the room and they told us that it is their room theme and design. Whereas they offered us a higher room category which is the premier (the suite rooms were not available). We paid the extra amount and went to the premier room. The room and bathroom were very spacious and the bed was massive. We were satisfied with the room than before. We do understand that their theme and design is about simplicity, not a fancy luxury room. Yet, the room is not worth the value. The rooms are built on a very cheap cost for sure. On the other hand, the food was superb. Presentation is fabulous. Dinner was served through a set menu and the breakfast was a mini buffet. We had an aromatherapy at the spa. The spa did not have the latest amenities but the staff were friendly. The view from the spa is very relaxing. Although we checked-in for a full board stay, we decided to leave on half board. Overall, the 98 acres resort is not what we expected it to be. The staff is lovely but specially the standard rooms required a renovation or a redesigning.",Date of stay: June 2019

The spacious balcony has a view of Little Adams Peak, and we sat for hours there enjoying the peacefulness and nature. Little Adams Peak is a short walk from the hotel - other people cut through the hotel to get there. The restaurant serves some impressive food, and the breakfast buffet has good selection. We ordered room service for a late lunch, and the staff were kind enough to give us some complimentary cakes and sweets for dessert afterwards. Small gestures like this really made us feel welcome.
